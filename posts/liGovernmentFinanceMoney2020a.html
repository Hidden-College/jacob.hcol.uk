title: "Notes on Government Finance and Money Creation in China: An MMT Perspective"
---

<p>Seems like there are a few things of note</p>
<ul>
<li>China's current day money creation is fairly standard, credit-based
not esoterically-Communist or MMT-like</li>
<li>MMT advocates are really concerned with drawing a "monetary-fiscal"
distinction
<ul>
<li>Will China pay for healthcare if they run a bigger deficit?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
