<h1 id="chapter-1-investment-vs.-speculation">Chapter 1: Investment vs.
Speculation</h1>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Investors</em> are those who <em>invest</em> their money,
seeking to effectively balance risk and suredness-of-return, whereas
<em>speculators</em> seek to predict future fluctuations and achieve
massive returns.</li>
<li>The thought processes behind <em>investment</em> and
<em>speculation</em> are different, and the two "disciplines" ought to
be separated</li>
<li>Buying common stock was seldom considered a safe investment until
<em>after</em> the 1949-1958 boom.</li>
<li>Results to be expected by the <em>defensive investor</em>:
<ul>
<li>The defensive investor, per classic Graham and Dodd wisdom, holds
25-75% in common stocks and an inverse 25-75% in bonds.</li>
<li>We cannot be sure that bonds will work out better than stocks, but
either way, they both have different risk profiles</li>
<li>Note the advent of TIPS, where bonds are automatically protected
against inflation by force of contract</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Results to be expected by the <em>aggressive</em> investor:
<ul>
<li>What are some strategies speculators and investors use to beat the
market?
<ul>
<li>Trading in the market</li>
<li>Short-term selectivity</li>
<li>Long-term selectivity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>p34, "In our view the search for these would not be worth the
investor’s effort unless he could hope to add, say, 5% before taxes to
the average annual return from the stock portion of his portfolio."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commentary-on-chapter-1">Commentary on Chapter 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>p35, "Investing, to Graham, consists equally of three elements"
<ul>
<li>you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its
underlying businesses, before you buy its stock;</li>
<li>you must deliberately protect against serious losses</li>
<li>you must aspire to "adequate," not extraordinary, performance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Speculators, of course, do none of these things</li>
<li>p36, "People who <em>invest</em> make money for themselves; people
who <em>speculate</em> make money for their brokers. And that, in turn,
is why Wall Street perennially downplays the durable virtues of
investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation."</li>
<li>The story of finance as a "nonstop national videogame," which caused
people to forget its underlying value-base, and the story of "financial
strategies" which "worked" until they were disseminated (either because
widespread practice "breaks" them, or because they only "worked" due to
correlation, and not causation)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chapter-2-the-investor-and-inflation">Chapter 2: The Investor
and Inflation</h1>
<ul>
<li>"Cash is trash" - holders of stocks, however, can hope that a
weakening of the dollar correlates with a strengthening in stocks</li>
<li>Cash has the same problem as bonds (even with interest?)</li>
<li>Even high-quality stocks cannot be <em>better</em> than bonds
<em>under all conditions</em>; <em>any</em> financial instrument
<em>x</em> cannot be better than <em>y</em> under <em>all
conditions</em></li>
<li>Ultimately, inflation is not an independent factor which increases
the value of common stocks — while common stocks tend to go up over time
(and may go down at any time), they don't go up "with" inflation; an
aggregate of other factors make it appear that way</li>
<li>Footnotes recommend not investing in gold directly, but rather a
well-priced mutual fund made of a composite of natural resource /
mineral firms</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commentary-on-chapter-2">Commentary on Chapter 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most of this commentary seems irrelevant; it was written at a time
when inflation was hovering around 1%!</li>
<li>Most of the advice amounts to "always be prepared"</li>
<li>REITs and TIPS</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chapter-3-a-century-of-stock-market-history">Chapter 3: A
Century of Stock Market History</h1>
<ul>
<li>In the first edition (1949), it seemed as though the inclusion of
common stocks in a portfolio needed to be intensively justified</li>
<li>"Rules for the Common Stock Component"
<ul>
<li>Adequate, though not excessive diversification (10-30)
<ul>
<li>One wonders whether more diversification is possible/desirable after
the advent of the internet and ways to check financials on the fly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each company selected should be large, prominent, and conservatively
financed</li>
<li>Each company should have a long record of continuous divident
payments. (All the issues in the DJIA met this requirement in 1971.)
<ul>
<li>Footnotes suggest 10-20 years of continuous dividends</li>
<li>It seems as though value investing is aided by reminding oneself
that the <em>purpose</em> of a stock is to return dividends, at least
historically, even though the return through a change in value might
make a much bigger impact on one's portfolio</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commentary-on-chapter-3">Commentary on Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Nothing from the commentary seems particularly noteworthy here,
except for this statement, p. 81:</p>
<p>In the April 10, 2000, issue of BusinessWeek, Jeffrey M. Apple- gate,
then the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, asked
rhetorically: “Is the stock market riskier today than two years ago
simply because prices are higher? The answer is no.” — But the answer is
<em>yes</em>. It always has been. It always will be.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-4-portfolio-policy-for-the-defensive-investor">Chapter
4: Portfolio Policy for the Defensive Investor</h1>
<ul>
<li>"It has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot afford
to take risks should be content with a relatively low return on their
invested funds."</li>
<li>Bond-stock allocation — the 25-75 ratio discussed earlier
<ul>
<li>p. 89, "These copybook maxims have always been easy to enunciate and
always difficult to follow—because they go against that very human
nature which produces that excesses of bull and bear markets."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Yale had a 50-50 endowment after 1937; this has since advanced to
61% in equity</li>
<li>The bond component
<ul>
<li>Everything seems to be issue-by-issue based; tax-free municipal
bonds are a better choice for higher tax brackets, taxed corporate bonds
for lower brackets.</li>
<li>Longer and shorter maturities: "Does the investor want to assure
himself against a decline in the price of his bonds, but at the cost of
(1) a lower annual yield and (2) loss of the possibility of an
appreciable gain in principal value?"</li>
<li>Note on high yield bonds: higher-yield bonds are usually such
because the issues are of lower quality; the price of the bond might
decline, and there is a higher chance of default.</li>
<li>Call provisions: when only slightly higher than the issue price,
"heads I win, tails you lose."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nonconvertible preferred stocks: Not as safe as it might initially
seems; if the company is unable to pay dividends on its common stock,
the preferred stock is already precarious. Buy at a bargain.
<ul>
<li>Other security forms besides stocks and bonds: many securities, like
income bonds, offer better contractual protection than these forms, but
yet are seldom used (and thus their value says low.)
<ul>
<li>Interest on income bonds is tax deductible!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commentary-on-chapter-4">Commentary on Chapter 4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why should age deteremine the amount of risk you take?
<ul>
<li>Graham concurs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Risk is a choice, and the advisable choice depends on the specific
situation</li>
<li>Bonds are generally sold in $10,000 lots; you'd need more than
$100,000 to diversify, so just buy into a bond fund.</li>
<li>This chapter also predates inflation adjusted treasury
securities</li>
<li>Other securities

<h1
id="chapter-6-portfolio-policy-for-the-enterprising-investor-negative-approach">Chapter
6: Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor, Negative
Approach</h1>
<ul>
<li>"The “aggressive” investor should start from the same base as the
defensive investor, namely, a division of his funds between high-grade
bonds and high-grade common stocks bought at reasonable prices.*"
<ul>
<li>This is an abstruse way to say enterprising/aggressive does not
depend on risk but on effort</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second-grade bonds: nonconvertible bonds sold at a discount since
the issues are often older, these might offer substantial return if they
deliver on their yield. Graham calls them too risky.</li>
<li>New issues generally are sold under "favourable market conditions,"
<em>i.e.</em> favourable for the seller.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commentary-on-chapter-6">Commentary on Chapter 6</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bond funds mitigate quite a bit of the risk of second-rate (now
called "junk") bonds</li>
<li>Foreign bonds are, of course, less risky now, and can still (as
always) hedge against the Dow being down.</li>
<li>Buying IPOs violates one of Graham's most fundamental rules: No
matter how many other people want to buy a stock, you should buy only if
the stock is a cheap way to own a desirable business.</li>
</ul>
<h1
id="chapter-7-portfolio-policy-for-the-enterprising-investor-the-positive-side">Chapter
7: Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor, The Positive
Side</h1>
<ul>
<li>The enterprising investor might be interested in the following
"special" opportunity <em>[these are all American, and maybe not
relevant for me]</em>
<ul>
<li>Tax-free New Housing Authority bonds</li>
<li>Taxable but high-yielding New Community bonds</li>
<li>Tax-free industrial bonds issued by municipalities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are low-quality bonds
<ul>
<li>Distressed/defaulted bonds: Bonds of a default company which has a
chance of recovering from bankruptcy
<ul>
<li>Under the right conditions, can perform as well as common
stocks</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Operations in common stocks
<ul>
<li>Buying in low markets and selling in high markets (arbitrage)</li>
<li>Buying "growth stocks"</li>
<li>Buying bargain issues of various types</li>
<li>Buying into special situations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"the market’s action in the past 20 years has not lent itself to
operations of this sort on any mathematical basis."
<ul>
<li>Malkiel</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1949-1972 is still too short of a span to draw "objective"
conclusions
<ul>
<li>This makes most of technical analysis pseudoscience then, no?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Investment Companies</em>, Arthur Wiesenburger and Co — growth
fund annual performance analysis</li>
<li>For growth stocks, Graham <em>insists</em> on calculating P/E based
on a multiyear average of past earnings</li>
<li>Three recommended fields for "enterprising investment"
<ul>
<li>To obtain better than average investment results, some policy must
(1) meet rational rests of underlying soundness, (2) be different than
the policy followed by most investors <em>or</em> speculators.</li>
<li>1. The Relatively Unpopular Large Company</li>
<li>2. Purchase of Bargain Issues
<ul>
<li>"An issue that is worth more than it is selling for"
<ul>
<li>There are two tests for this
<ul>
<li>Appraisal, estimation of future earnings…</li>
<li>Value of a business to a private owner, which is also determined by
future earnings, but more attention to assets will be paid here</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>3. Special Situations
<ul>
<li>Buy into lawsuits?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commentary-on-chapter-7">Commentary on Chapter 7</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nobody can find out the worst days of the market before they arrive.
<ul>
<li>The commentator notes that the word "truth" in investment articles
is often a sign of imminent lies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finding bargains is work.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chapter-8-the-investor-and-market-fluctuations">Chapter 8: The
Investor and Market Fluctuations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Market fluctuations as a guide to investment decisions
<ul>
<li>Investors who place stock in the future short-term price
(unpredictable) are in danger of becoming speculators</li>
<li>It is probably better to just embrace not having the knowledge</li>
<li>"Undoubtedly <em>some</em> people can make money by being good stock
market analysts. But it is absurd to think that the <em>general
public</em> can ever make money out of market forecasts. For who will
buy when the general public rushes to sell at a profit?"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BLSH Approach
<ul>
<li>"Without bear markets to take stock prices down, any one looking to
buy low will be left behind"</li>
<li>There is not really a bull-bear pattern in the modern day, and there
is not appropriate signalling when these shift</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Formula Plans
<ul>
<li>A good way to put logical principles on rails</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Business valuations
<ul>
<li>In essence, market price vs. NAV.</li>
<li>"The whole structure of stock-market quotations contains a built-in
contradiction. The better a company’s record and prospects, the less
relationship the price of its shares will have to their book
value."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"The true investor scarcely ever is <em>forced</em> to sell his
shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price
quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the
extent that it suits his book, and no more."
<ul>
<li>"Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly
worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely
transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man
would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he
would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons’
mistakes of judgment."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fluctuations in bond prices
<ul>
<li>Basically, the same
<ul>
<li>A lot of what bond advice Graham gives is outmoded by TIPS</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commentary-on-chapter-8">Commentary on Chapter 8</h2>
<ul>
<li>You don't have to <em>agree</em> with Mr. Market — only take
advantage of his offers when it benefits you.</li>
