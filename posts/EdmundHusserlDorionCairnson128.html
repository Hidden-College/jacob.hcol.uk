belongs an initial clarification of "judicative" doing and the
"judgement" itself, and discrimination of <em>immediate</em> and
<em>mediate</em> judgements</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Mediate</em> - sense-relatedness to other judgements</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Mediate judgements are such that believing B implies A as
grounding; there is a "getting-at". If light behaves like this between
two slits, that <em>implies</em> knowledge about photons.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The showing of "grounding judgements" is itself mediate - one can
"return" to the grounding at will once it is determined. The discovery
of grounding is an enduring acquisition and is called a
"cognition".</p></li>
<li><p>Judgements which are "correct" are also "agreeing."</p></li>
<li><p>"Grounding" is an <em>agreement</em> of the judgement with the
judgement-verdict, <em>i.e.</em> the facts of the case</p></li>
<li><p>The judgement is a "complex of states of affairs," but there is
sometimes a pre-eminent judicative meaning.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>e.g.</em> Judgement: Cells need ATP to generate
glucose</p></li>
<li><p><em>e.g.</em> Pre-eminent judicative meaning: Some indispensable
sign this is happening?</p></li>
<li><p>The pre-eminent judicative meaning is called "evidence"</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Now it seems we have a typology:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Mediate judgements: The witnessing of cell behaviour</p></li>
<li><p>Immediate judgements: The grounding theory of cell
respiration</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence: The grounding of cell respiration in cell behaviour in
hypoxic environments</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A scientist does not accept something as scientific unless he can
freely return to its grounding.</p></li>
<li><p>Distinguishing "judgement" without qualification and "evidence"
without qualification from "pre-predicative judgement" and
"pre-predicative evidence."</p>
<ol>
<li><p>That which is meant or evidently viewed receives "predicative
expression," <em>i.e.</em> something is said of the thing.</p></li>
<li><p>But the predicate can fit or not fit the evidence
variably.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence for the predicate fitting the state of affairs is thus
also an input into the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Scientific truth is <em>predicative complexes that can be
grounded absolutely.</em></p></li>

phrase "absolute certainty" and "absolute indubitability" need
clarifying, because when we say we need perfect evidence, we need to lay
out what kind of perfection we mean. In our prescientific understanding,
<em>imperfection</em> is about incompleteness. It is about holes.
Another way of saying "evidence without too many holes" is <em>adequate
evidence.</em></h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Absolute indubitability: In other words, <em>apodicticity</em>.
This is the type of absolute indubitability "a scientist demands of all
his principles." It is revealed by the scientist's endeavour to,
regarding groundings that are already self-evident, to ground them in
further groundings and bestow upon them the "highest dignity" of
apodicticity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A definition of apodicticity: Consider evidence; evidence
presupposes the existence of the thing. But it does not exclude the
possibility that "what is evident could become doubtful." This
possibility can always be recognised when you critically reflect on what
the evidence "does." An <em>apodictic</em> evidence, upon this sort of
critical reflection, shows that the possibility of non-being for said
evidence is unimaginable.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Apodicticity is recursive: evidence of apodicticity must be
apodictic, and so must the evidence of the evidence of the
apodicticity…</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>This absolute indubitability is Descartes' principle for building
genuine science: the exclusion of all doubts, even frivolous
brain-in-vat ones.</p></li>
<li><p>We have acquired that principle in a clarified form now, and seen
that the project of science is a striving to reach it.</p></li>
