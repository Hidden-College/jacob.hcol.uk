<ol>
<li><p>Sales and revenue mean the "top line"</p></li>
<li><p>Profits, earnings and income mean the "bottom line"</p></li>
<li><p>Costs are money spent making a product; expenses are money spent
to develop it, sell it, account for it, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Both <em>costs</em> and <em>expenses</em> become
<em>expenditures</em> when money is actually sent to vendors to pay for
them.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Orders</em> are placed by customers and signify a request for
future delivery; they don't impact the books until this happens, and
they become <em>shipments</em> or <em>sales</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Solvency</em> means having enough money in the bank to pay
your bills, whereas <em>profitability</em> means that your sales are
greater than your <em>costs</em> and your <em>expenses.</em></p></li>
<li><p>You can be profitable and insolvent at the same time; you are
making money, but still do not have enough cash to pay all your
bills.</p></li>
<li><p>After understanding vocabs, you can learn the 3 main financial
statements:</p>

<h3 id="terminology-1">Terminology</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>The 12 "very" important accounting principles are as
follows:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accounting entity</strong>, which is the business unit
for which hte financial statements are being prepared. There is a
"business entity" seperate from its owners, a fictional corporate
"person."</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Going concern</strong>, <em>i.e.</em> the notion that the
life of the business entity is infinitely long.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If during a review, an accountant believes a company may go
bankrupt, he <em>must</em> issue a <strong>qualified opinion</strong>
stating the potential of this.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Measurement</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, accounting only
deals with things that can be measured; things that cannot be measured,
like brand loyalty or swag, are not stated in books.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Accounting books only contain the difference between quantifiable
<strong>assets</strong> and quantifiable <strong>liabilites</strong>,
the difference between the two equalling
<strong>equity</strong>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Units of Measure</strong> correlate to the jurisdiction
the company is based out of — U.S. companies measure everything in USD,
and foreign subsidiaries have their values converted to USD for
consolidative ease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Historical Cost</strong>, <em>i.e.</em> what a company
owns and owes are recorded as <em>cost paid</em> with no adjustment for
inflation.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Even if this leads to undervaluing, it is the easiest thing to
do.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Materiality</strong> refers to the relative importance of
different financial information — all transactions <em>must</em> be
reported if they would <em>materially</em> affect the financial
condition of the company. This is different for the corner store and for
IBM.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Estimates and judgements</strong> must often be made for
financial reporting; often in the case of lack-of-info and
lack-of-materiality. Accountants, however, should use the <em>same
guessing method for each period.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency</strong> is important. Identical transactions
<em>can</em> be accounted for differently using different accounting
methods — each enterprise <em>must</em> choose a single method of
reporting to mitigate value being mis-represented due to
inconsistencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conservatism</strong> is the general attitude towards
valuation — value losses when they are likely to happen, but only value
gains <em>after</em> they happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Periodicity</strong> is the notion that the life of a
corporation can be divided into periods of time, for which profits and
losses can be recorded. These are really just convenient periods; short
enough to be within memory (and reasonably timely and useful), and long
enough to have meaning and not just be random fluctuations.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>These periods are called "fiscal periods" and may or may not
align with actual calendar months/years.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Substance over Form</strong>, <em>i.e.</em> accountants
report the economic "substance" of a transaction rather than just its
form. One might be inclined to report a purchase <em>as</em> an
equipment lease; but this is forbidden.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accrual Basis of Presentation</strong> is very important
to understand. Accountaints translate into dollars of profit or loss all
the money-making activities that take place during a fiscal period.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In <em>accrual accounting</em>, if a business action in a period
makes money, then all its product costs and its business expenses should
be reported in that period</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This is accomplished by matching for presentation</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(a) the refenue received in selling product</p></li>
<li><p>(b) the costs to make the product sold</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Key to accrual accounting is</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Revenue recognition</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, recording a
sale when all the necessary activities have been undergone. Revenue is
generated when a product is shipped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matching principle</strong> — COGS (cost of goods sold)
is recorded when the sale-revenue is</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Allocation</strong> — Costs that cannot be associated
with a product can be allocated to fiscal periods in a "reasonable
fashion."</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>These rules are made by the <strong>FASB</strong> and they are
called <strong>GAAP</strong>.</p></li>

<h3 id="terminology-2">Terminology</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>basic equation of accounting</strong> is
<strong>Assets - Liabilities = Worth</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Worth, net worth, equity, owner's equity, and shareholder equity
all mean the same thing.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> restates the basic equation as
<strong>Assets = Liabilities + Worth</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You must keep tabs on variables such that this always holds
true</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The balance sheet is a <strong>snapshot</strong> in
time.</p></li>
<li><p>The balance sheet reports "has today = owes today + worth
today"</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assets</strong> are everything you've got, in addition to
certain "rights" you own; but they must be quantifiable.</p></li>
<li><p>Assets are grouped on the balance sheet according to their
characteristics: first <em>very liquid assets</em>, <em>productive
assets</em>, and finally <em>assets for sale</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accounts receivable</strong> are a special type of asset
group: the obligation of customers to pay a company for goods shipped to
them</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assets</strong> are displayed in the asset section of the
balance sheet; <strong>cash</strong> is the most liquid, <strong>fixed
assets</strong> are the least liquid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Assets</strong> are those assets that are
expected to be converted into cash in less than 12 months.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Assets</strong> are also grouped by
liquidity:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Cash</p></li>
<li><p>Accounts Receivable</p></li>
<li><p>Inventory</p></li>
<li><p>Prepaid Expenses</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The money the company will use to pay its bills will come when
its <strong>current assets</strong> are converted into cash
(<em>i.e.</em> when inventory is sold, and accounts receivable are
paid)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash</strong> is the ultimate liquid asset</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accounts Receivable</strong> is the total of the entity's
<em>rights</em> to collect some money from a customer at a specified
time in the future.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inventory</strong> is both finished products
ready-to-sell and raw materials which can be made into
products.</p></li>
<li><p>A manufacturer has a three-part inventory consisting of:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Raw material inventory</p></li>
<li><p>Work-in-process inventory</p></li>
<li><p>Finished goods inventory</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>As <em>finished goods inventory</em> is sold, it becomes
<em>accounts receivable</em>, and then <em>cash</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prepaid Expenses</strong> are bills the company has paid,
but not received the resulting service — telephone, rent, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepaid expenses cannot be turned into cash, but they are still
assets because they will not require money in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Current assets form a so-called <strong>current asset
cycle</strong>, where <em>cash</em> becomes <em>inventory</em> which
then becomes <em>accounts receivable</em>, which then becomes
<em>cash</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also <strong>non-current assets</strong> like <em>other
assets</em> and <em>fixed assets</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed assets are often referred to as <strong>PP&amp;E</strong>,
or <strong>property, plant, and equipment</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed assets are often reported as <strong>fixed assets at
cost</strong>, <em>i.e.</em> at the original purchase price.</p></li>
<li><p>They are also shown as <strong>net fixed assets</strong>, which
provides allowance for depreciation (but not appreciation due to
inflation or market shifts.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Depreciation</strong> is an accounting convention
reporting the decline in useful value of a fixed asset due to
time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Depreciation charges</strong> <em>do</em> lower profits
(since it is a liability) but do not affect cash.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Depreciation</strong> on a balance sheet may be
uncorrelated with the real-life value of the asset entirely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other assets</strong> is a category that includes
non-current assets which are unable to be classified, like
patent-rights, trademarks, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Liabilities</strong> are economic obligations of the
enterprise; they are categorised based on to <em>whom</em> the debt is
owed and whether the debt is to be paid within the year (current
liabilities.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current liabilities</strong> are liabilities that
<em>must</em> be paid within the year.</p></li>
<li><p>The current liabilities are grouped depending on to whom the debt
is owed: <em>accounts payable</em> owed to suppliers, <em>accrued
expenses</em> owed to employees and others for services, <em>current
debt</em> owed to lenders, and <em>income taxes payable</em> owed to the
government.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accounts Payable</strong> are bills that the corporation
<em>must</em> pay soon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accrued Expenses</strong> are monetary obligations
similar to accounts payable, but for different creditors - salaries
earned but not yet paid, lawyer's bills not yet paid, interest due but
not yet paid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Portion of Debt</strong> is the debt owed to a
bank within the next 12 months.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long Term Debt</strong> is debt owed outwith the next 12
months, for example, a mortgage.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a <strong>current portion of long-term debt</strong>,
which is the portion of the long-term debts that is payable within the
next 12 months.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Income Taxes Payable</strong> are taxes owed but not yet
paid; every 3 months the company will send the government a cheque, but
for the time between when the profit was made and the taxes were paid,
they will occupy this spot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Working capital</strong>: Current Assets - Current
Liabilities = Working Capital. It is also called "net current assets" or
"funds."</p></li>
<li><p>Working capital increases when <em>current liabilities
decrease</em> or <em>current assets increase</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Working capital can be used up when <em>current assets</em>
decrease or <em>current liabilities</em> increase.</p></li>
<li><p>A company's <strong>total liabilities</strong> are just Current
Liabilities + Long Term Debt</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shareholder's Equity</strong> is the company's value to
its owners, <em>i.e.</em> liabilities minus assets, net worth, or book
value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Capital stock</strong> is the original money to start and
any add-on money invested in the business.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Retained earnings</strong> are all profits that have not
been returned to the shareholders as dividends; Retained Earnings = Sum
of all profits - Sum of all dividends</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shareholder's Equity</strong> is <em>also</em> the sum of
the investment made in the stock of the company, plus any profits minus
any dividends that have been paid to shareholders.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of shareholder equity <em>increases</em> when the
company</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Makes a profit (increasing <em>retained earnings</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Sells new stock (increasing <em>capital stock</em>)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The value of shareholder equity <em>decreases</em> when the
company</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Has a loss (decreasing <em>retained earnings</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Pays dividends (decreasing <em>retained earnings</em>)</p>

<h3 id="terminology-3">Terminology</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>income statement</strong> gives the business's
profitability</p></li>
<li><p>It does not tell the whole picture about a company's financial
health; instead, it works in tandem with the balance sheet (which
reports on assets, liabilities, and equity) and the cash flow statement
(which reports on cash movements).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Income</strong> = Sales - COGS - Operating
Expenses.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>second basic equation of accounting</em> is this:
<strong>Sales - (Costs &amp; Expenses) = Income</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sales</strong> are recorded on the income statement when
products are actually <em>shipped</em> to customers</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Orders</strong> are what sales are before they've
actually been shipped; when a <em>sale</em> is made, income is generated
on the income statement. <em>Orders</em> only increase the backlog of
products to be shipped.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Costs</strong> are expenditures for raw materials,
manufacturing, and labour - only when the goods are sold does
<em>cost</em> move from the balance sheet to the income statement as
<strong>COGS</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gross margin</strong> is <strong>Sales - COGS</strong>;
it is the <em>manufacturing margin</em> before other costs.</p></li>
<li><p>All other business expenditures that aren't <em>costs</em> are
<strong>expenses</strong>. These are both a subset of
<strong>expenditures</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expenses</strong> are non-good expenditures, like paying
legal fees, marketing, or R&amp;D. They directly lower income on the
income statement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating expenses</strong> are those expenditures that a
company makes <em>for the purpose of generating income</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating expenses</strong> are sometimes called
<strong>SG&amp;A</strong> expenses, <em>i.e.</em>, "sales, general, and
administrative" expenses.</p></li>
<li><p>The income statement is often referred to as the <em>profit and
loss statement</em>, <em>P&amp;L</em>, or the <em>earnings
statement</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Income from operations</strong> refers to what is left
over after both <em>expenses</em> and <em>costs</em> are subtracted from
net sales.</p></li>
<li><p>Companies can also generate income from <em>non-operating
activities</em>, <em>i.e</em> financial — <em>e.g.</em> the selling of
securities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-operating income</strong> includes categories like
<strong>interest income</strong>, <em>i.e.</em> interest received on
bank accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-operating expenses</strong> include <strong>interest
expense</strong> and <strong>income tax</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that <strong>income is not cash</strong>, and so a
company with lots of net income can still be insolvent, <em>i.e.</em>,
have no cash left to pay its bills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Profit and income</strong> do mean the same
thing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sales and revenue</strong> do mean the same
thing.</p></li>
<li><p>If income is measured when cash is received, the business is
operating on a <strong>cash basis</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>If income and expenses are measured when the transactions occur —
regardless of the physical flow of cash — the business is operating on a
<strong>accrual basis</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>With books on a <strong>cash basis</strong>, the income statement
and the cash flow statement are the same.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>accrual basis</strong> accounting, the income
statement does not reflect the movement of cash, but rather the
generation of obligations ("payables") to pay cash in the
future.</p></li>
<li><p>With <strong>accrual basis</strong> accounting, expenses occur
when the company incurs the <em>obligation</em> to pay, not when it
actually parts with the cash. Sales and costs are recorded when the
goods are shipped and customers incur the obligation to pay, not when
they actually pay.</p></li>
<li><p>If the enterprise's <em>income sheet</em> shows income, then
retained earnings are <em>increased</em> on the balance sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>When retained earnings <em>increase</em>, the enterprise's assets
must <em>increase</em> or the <em>liabilities</em> decrease for the
balance sheet to remain in balance.</p></li>

Statement)</h2>
<h3 id="terminology-4">Terminology</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong> tracks the <em>movement
of cash</em> through the business over a <em>period of
time</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>A company's cash flow statement is just like a cheque register —
recording all the company's transactions that use cash (cheques) or
supply cash (deposits).</p></li>
<li><p>The cash flow statement shows <strong>Cash At Start + Cash
Received - Cash Spent = Cash On-Hand</strong></p></li>
<li><p>So-called <strong>cash transactions</strong> affect cash flow.
For example, paying salaries, paying for equipment, paying off a
loan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-cash transactions</strong> are company activities
where no cash moves into or out of the company's accounts; non-cash
transactions have <em>no effect</em> on the cash flow statement, but
they can effect the income statement and balance sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>positive cash flow</strong> for a period means the
company has more cash at the end of the period than at the
beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>negative cash flow</strong> means the company has less
cash at the end of a period than at the beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>continuing negative cash flow</strong> means the
company is on the road to insolvency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash</strong> comes into the business in two major
ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1. Operating activities such as receiving payment from
customers.</p></li>
<li><p>2. Financing activities such as selling stock or borrowing
money.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash</strong> goes out of the business in four major
ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1. Operating activities such as paying suppliers and
employees.</p></li>
<li><p>2. Financial activities such as paying interest and principal, or
paying dividends.</p></li>
<li><p>3. Making major capital investments in long-lived productive
assets.</p></li>
<li><p>4. Paying income tax.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash from Operations</strong>, <em>i.e.</em> cash from
the day-to-day "conventional" activities of a business (making and
selling products), is shown separately from other cash flows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash receipts</strong> are inflows of money coming from
operating the business.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash disbursements</strong> are outflows of money coming
from operating the business.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash from operations</strong> = <strong>Cash receipts -
Cash disbursements</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash receipts</strong>, also called <em>collections</em>
or simply <em>receipts</em>, come from collecting money from
customers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash receipts</strong> increase the amount of cash the
company has on hand, but they are not profits.</p></li>
<li><p>Receiving cash from customers decreases the amount that is due
the company as <strong>accounts receivable</strong> shown on the
<strong>balance sheet</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash disbursements</strong> are, in effect, cheques
written — whether to pay for inventory, supplies, or a worker's salary.
They <em>lower</em> the amount of cash the company has on hand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash disbursements</strong> to suppliers <em>lower</em>
the amount the company owes as reported in <strong>accounts
payable</strong> on the balance sheet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash disbursements</strong> are also called
<em>payments</em> or simply <em>disbursements.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cash from operations</strong> reports the flow of money
into and out of the business from making and selling products, and as
such is only one of the important elements of cash flow, alongside</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Investment in fixed assets</p></li>
<li><p>Financial activities</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Fixed Asset Purchases</strong> are money spent to buy
<em>property, plant and equipment</em> — <em>i.e.</em> an investment in
the long term capability of the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Paying for PP&amp;E is <em>not</em> considered part of
operations, and thus is <em>not</em> reported in <em>cash disbursements
from operations</em>. Cash payments for PP&amp;E (<em>i.e.</em> fixed
asset purchases) are reported on a seperate line in the cash flow
statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Needless to say, after purchasing PP&amp;E the business has less
cash, but cash flow is not affected at all by
depreciation/amortisation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Net Borrowings</strong> is the difference between any new
borrowings in a period and the amount paid back, and is reported for the
period on a seperate line in the <em>Cash Flow Statement</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Income Taxes Paid</strong> is the income taxes paid —
which is different than the income taxes <em>owed</em>, per the
accrual-accounting practices of the balance sheet and income
statement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sale of Stock</strong> is the new equity sold; when a
company sells stock to investors, it receives money and increases the
amount of cash it has on hand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ending Cash Balance</strong> is the cash-on-hand at the
end of a given period.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that, while the cash flow statement is always unchanged in a
transaction where no cash actually changes hands, a <em>balance
sheet</em> or an <em>income statement</em> may be changed by a
<em>non-cash transaction.</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The fundamental reporting function of each of the three
statements is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <em>income statement</em> shows the manufacturoing and
selling actions of the enterprise that show a profit or loss.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>cash flow statement</em> details the movements of cash
into and out of the coffers of the enterprise.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>balance sheet</em> records what the company owns and what
it owes, including the owner's stake.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Each statement views the enterprise's financial health from a
different – and very necessary – perspective. Each statement relates to
the other two in specific ways; they have these "natural
connections"</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>sales cycle</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>expense cycle</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>investment cycle</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asset purchase/depreciation</strong></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>As you study the reporing of dollars and goods entering or
leaving a business,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1. Watch the flow of cash money</p></li>
<li><p>2. Watch the flow of goods and services</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Balance Sheet Connections</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Structural connections</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Ending cash balance</strong> on the <em>cash flow
statement</em> for the period always equals <strong>cash</strong> at
period end on the <em>balance sheet</em></p></li>
<li><p>As the basic equation of accounting states, <strong>total
assets</strong> always equals <strong>total liabilities</strong> +
<strong>shareholder's equity</strong> on the balance sheet.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>"Balancing" connections</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To keep the <em>balance sheet</em> in balance, when a transaction
is <strong>added</strong> to an asset account, an equal amount must be
<strong>subtracted</strong> from another asset account</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise, for liability accounts. In both cases, <strong>total
assets</strong> or <strong>total liabilities &amp; shareholder
equity</strong> do not change and maintain the balance on the
<em>balance sheet</em>.</p>
