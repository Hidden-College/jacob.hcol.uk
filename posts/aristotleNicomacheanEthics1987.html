is interesting that common sense is also worth considering, and why

intellectual, such as wisdom, judgement and practical wisdom, while
others are virtues of character, such as generosity and temperance. For
when we are talking about a person's character, we do not say that he is
wise or has judgement, but that he is even-tempered or temperate. Yet we
do praise the wise person for his state, and the states worthy of praise
we call virtues."</h2>
