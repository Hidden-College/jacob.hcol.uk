<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is interesting that common sense is also worth considering, and
why wouldn't it be? Obscurantism and philosophical "you're not part of
our club"-ism, I guess, which is just kind of for narcs</li>
<li>It seems like right action ought to arise from right-orderedness of
the soul (<em>i.e.</em> a healthy psyche)</li>
<li>Seperation of a human function, a human form in addition to its
matter: It doesn't seem strange to me that the "human function" or
"human form" could simply be a multifaceted, complex thing, like being
sapient.</li>
<li>"It is worth remembering that in Greek a horse that ran fast could
be said to have a `virtue' or excellence, in so far as it performed well
its characteristic activity."
<ul>
<li>Heidegger and his language argument again</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"What Aristotle means is that what is morally required is what the
virtuous person would do in our circumstances."
<ul>
<li>The Golden Mean is ultimately a normative doctrine</li>
<li><span class="citation"

</ul></li>
<li>Magnanimity is a profoundly un-Christian virtue if one is concerned
purely with honour, but surely, if one "stands their ground" in the
sense that they develop a personal relationship with God, it can become
a Christian virtue?</li>
<li>"The law ultimately aims at the instantiation of virtue in the
citizens it governs"
<ul>
<li>This seems more and more desirable by the second</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Does justice "fit into the mold of the doctrine of the mean"?
<ul>
<li>"An unwillingness to exert one's rights is not any kind of
injustice"
<ul>
<li>Maybe an injustice toward oneself?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Seemingly this is a problem of supererogation. Is excessive
supererogation an injustice toward oneself?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Ethics is not capturable in a set of explicit principles"
<ul>
<li>Maybe it is like logic, then, which shares notions of logical
consequence such that there is something "done" when you do logic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Knowledge of the incontinent
<ul>
<li>It seems like empirical psych, in addition to even psychoanalysis,
is much more accomplished in solving this problem</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pleasure is "unimpeded activity of one's natural state", but also
not an end-in-itself
<ul>
<li>"The pleasures of philosophy are the pleasures of God"</li>
</ul></li>

<h1 id="book-1-on-happiness">Book 1 – on happiness</h1>
<ul>
<li>"The products are by their nature better than the activities"</li>
<li>A lot of actions, even entire sciences, are pursued for the sake of
something else
<ul>
<li>I guess entire lifetime endeavors ("I am an electronic engineer")
can be done in service of some unknown, greater end</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maybe the virtue of magnanimity can be reframed as being "confident
in the target" in a sense? We have no idea whether we have hit the right
target for the good. It is basically mysterious.</li>
<li>Mature people are more suited to speak on matters of the good; I
would agree, insofar as the answer is not given from without</li>
<li>Hesiod's hierarchy is interesting (Understanders &gt; knowers &gt;
neither), but again, it seems that a standing of one's ground throws a
wrench into this.</li>
<li>"Nobody would call a person living this kind of life happy, unless
he were closely defending a thesis"
<ul>
<li>This is interesting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All of the "lives" Aristotle discusses seemingly are not hitting the
targeted end.</li>
<li>Shocker, Aristotle is an ontotheologian — it seems that saying the
prior things are substance, quality implies God is a substance with
qualities just like any other</li>
<li>Happiness is believed to be complete without qualification
<ul>
<li>I think you can reverse this and say "that state of being which is
good without qualification" and end up with a better ethics than trying
to find a candidate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>1097b, Self-sufficiency for Aristotle means "a unit that carries its
weight" almost</li>
<li>Approaching the good like a <em>geometer</em> and not a
<em>carpenter</em> is important, but it also seems like Aristotle's work
is not actually doing that. Rather, it is discovering necessary
corollaries and things relational to the good <em>if it were to exist,
and whatever it may be</em>.</li>
<li><em>All data harmonises with the truth, but soon clashes with
falsity.</em></li>
<li>Why are goods of the soul the goodest?
<ul>
<li>But it seems the <em>use</em> of the good of the soul is where its
goodness lies.</li>
<li>Seems an early form of pragmatism to me.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The happy person is someone who "engages in activities in accordance
with complete virtue," but it seems like this happiness will disappear
with bad fortune when there is not external cooperation.
<ul>
<li>Again, this might be where magnanimity is valuable. Knowing
<em>your</em> happiness, and knowing you are happy; since nobody else
can judge whether someone is happy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Again, there seems to be this tacit acknoledgement of the permanence
of the good, and a locating-it-without-grasping-it, in the notion that
(1100b) activity in accordance with virtue "outlasts even the sciences."
<ul>
<li>I guess you could be an emotivist or a social constructivist about
it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aristotle's focus on honour is interesting because of how
out-of-place it seems now, esp. the discourse on the dead. There is some
interesting anthropology to be done there.</li>
<li>The eros, logos, and thymos trichotomy resurfaces, not as formal
aspects but as things present in the soul.
<ul>
<li>And logos, viz. the element with reason, is isolated as the unique
factor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Virtue is distinguished along the same lines. Some virtues we say
are intellectual, such as wisdom, judgement and practical wisdom, while
others are virtues of character, such as generosity and temperance. For
when we are talking about a person's character, we do not say that he is
wise or has judgement, but that he is even-tempered or temperate. Yet we
do praise the wise person for his state, and the states worthy of praise
we call virtues."</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="book-2-on-the-states-of-the-soul">Book 2 – on the states of the
soul</h1>
<ul>
<li>Woah, woah, woah, <em>why</em> are we sorting virtue into that of
the intellect and that of character? You're not Plato, justify your
claims!
<ul>
<li>Oh, nevermind, he does it in the last book</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A lot of the discussion of abstention from pleasures and so on seems
essentially psychological, even physiological, but this is also not
really problematic at all. Applying logic to practicalities, even when
the answer isn't "cool" or "esoteric" or fun, leads to useful and good
results.</li>
<li>The claim that education is instruction/conditioning on how to "find
pleasure or pain in the right things" seems dubious; aren't pleasures
somewhat primordial?</li>
<li>"Like states give rise to activities"
<ul>
<li>It seems like what Aristotle is <em>glossing</em> over is the
holistic, experiential knowledge (knowledge about how much attention to
pay to someone in a social interaction, for instance) gained from doing
the activity somehow gives rise to a happier psyche</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Virtues are produced and developed from the same origins and by the
same means as those from/by which they are corrupted</li>
<li>It seems like, to Aristotle, this is only metaphysical insofar as it
is practical. Of course someone who experiences an event <em>A</em> is
going to cut out the natural, reasoned apprehension of <em>A</em>.</li>
<li>"finds his enjoyment in [being temperate]" -&gt; knows what he
<em>really</em> wants</li>
<li>"Every state of the soul is naturally related to, and concerned
with, the kind of things by which it is naturally made better or worse."
<ul>
<li>Temperacy is concerned with bodily pleasures, ergo, for the soul,
temperacy is made better or worse by bodily pleasures</li>
<li>It seems like this is more of a defining than an elucidating of the
soul. Are parts of us which do not follow this pattern simply
not-soul?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With respect to "objects of choice" Aristotle argues
<ul>
<li><em>good</em> person chooses the noble, useful, pleasant</li>
<li><em>bad</em> person chooses shameful, harmful, painful
<ul>
<li><em>shameful</em> seems a strange virtue to place here, if only
because Aristotle is concerned with honour</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actions done in accordance with <em>skills</em> have their worth
"within themselves," but actions done in accordance with
<em>virtues</em> are done because of <em>the manner in which</em> they
are done
<ul>
<li><em>i.e.</em>, there is a metaphysical difference between something
with a good externality and something done for a good reason</li>
<li>A virtuous act to A requires
<ul>
<li><strong>K</strong> nowledge</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> ational choice of the actions for their own
sake</li>
<li><strong>F</strong> irm and unshakeable character</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Maybe this can be rephrased as
<ul>
<li><strong>K</strong> nowledge</li>
<li><strong>F</strong> irm and unshakeable character</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> hoice of the actions for their own sake</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Anger and afraidness are affectations, virtues and vices are a sort
of structuring of the soul in which impetuses properly flow to
actions</li>
<li>Chapter 6 has some gems; virtue of the eye, golden mean</li>
<li>The golden mean is <em>not to be attained in accordance to
arithmetic progression</em>
<ul>
<li>Each person has her own mean</li>
<li>Virtue is concerned with feelings and actions, in which excess and
deficiency constitute <em>misses of the mark</em>, while the mean is
praised and <em>on target</em>, both of which are characteristics of
virtue. Virtue, then, is a kind of mean, at least in the sense that it
is the sort of thing that is <em>able to hit a mean</em>.
<ul>
<li>greek linguistics - what is the word for "mean" here?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>"For good people are just good, while bad people are bad in all
sorts of ways."</li>
<li>What is honour to Aristotle?</li>
<li>With respect to the remaining kind of pleasantness, that found in
life in general, let us call the person who is pleasant in the right way
friendly and the mean friendliness, while he who goes to excess will be
obsequious if there is no reason for it, and a ¯atterer if he is out for
his own ends; someone who falls short and is unpleasant all the time
will be a quarrelsome and peevish sort of person.</li>
<li>For every "field" there are three dispositions - excessive (vice),
deficiency (vice), mean (virtue). It seems they are in a dialectic
relationship with one another, although not a temporal-procedural
one.</li>
<li>The mean seems adjustable
<ul>
<li>The extremes might be too far on either side of the mean</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Proto-original sin right here folks? "It is the things to which we
ourselves are naturally more inclined that appear more contrary to the
mean; for example, we are naturally more inclined to pleasures, and are
therefore more prone to intemperance than self-discipline."</li>
<li>Excellence in these things is noble because they are rare — again,
it seems as though he is making a comment on the human condition more
than the statistical amount of virtuous people. Proto-fallenness.</li>
<li>Aristotle seems to think that missing pleasure is categorically
good, which conflicts with his own teaching of the mean.</li>
<li>"But how far and to what extent someone must deviate before becoming
blameworthy it is not easy to determine by reason, because nothing
perceived by our senses is easily determined; such things are
particulars, and judgement about them lies in perception."</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="book-iii--">Book III - ???</h1>
<ul>
<li>Voluntary vs. involuntary
<ul>
<li>An action which is done under duress can have the quality
"voluntary" and "involuntary" applied to it
<ul>
<li>LNC? LNC???</li>
<li>Maybe there are certain <em>aspects</em> to which it is voluntary
and to which it is involuntary.</li>
<li></li>
